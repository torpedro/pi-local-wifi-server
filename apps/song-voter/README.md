This is an example implementation for which the Local Wifi Setup can be used.

This is a song voter. Users can access the website at http://play.mysong/ when connected to the Wifi Network.
On the site they can enter songs they would like to hear.
The hosts can access the database and decide if they want to play the songs that the users have requested.
